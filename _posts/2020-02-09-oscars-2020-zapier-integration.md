# Oscars® 2020 Zapier integration

tl;dr: I made a Zapier integration so you can send a Tweet, post a Slack message, etc. any time a new
Oscars® 2020 winner is announced.

Zapier is an automation platform that lets you connect events and actions from your favourite apps, so you
can build a workflow that, for example, sends a message to a Slack channel every time a particular user has a new tweet.

I built a Zapier integration that allows you to trigger an action when a new Oscars® 2020 winner is announced.
