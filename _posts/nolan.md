## Following

## Memento

- Is a person the collection of their memories and experiences?
- Does the story work only by being told backwards?
- Showing the color sequences in reverse lets the viewer try to undestand what the protagonist goes through.
- The opening credits and intro showing the Polaroid being developed and Teddy being shot in reverse is just great.
- Loved the macro? shot of the casing rolling back into the gun, the blood flowing backwards, the glasses getting back to Teddy's face.
- Showing this in reverse makes it seem less violent somehow.
- How does this relate to the overall "time theme" of Nolan? Perhaps: memory is the way in which consciousness experiences the flow of time. "Perpetual present."
- Does the film use a "noir" palette?
- Pantoliano's character is like a friendly villain.
- Moss' acting is very subtle in that gestures you thought were genuine in the first viewing are obviously fake in the second one.
- Not as mindblowing as the first and second time that I saw it but it has definitely aged gracefully.
