# Courses

## Version Control Systems (git)

### Prerequisites

- Basic shell usage

### What is a VCS?

### Why is it useful?

- Collaboration: many people working on the same project
- Accountability and auditing: who did what, when and why?
- Being able to undo stuff (features, release rollbacks)
- Pinpointing regressions

### git

- Distributed
- Concepts: remote, commits (graph), branch
- Actions: checkout, commit, rebase, cherry pick, blame, stash, bisect, reflog, stash, ...
- Conflict resolution

#### Concepts

##### Remote

> Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.

[source](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)

```sh
git clone git@github.com:thewarpaint/git-course.git
```

Different protocols: SSH and SSH keys, HTTPS and username/password.

https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use

```sh
git remote -v
```

In some setups/collaboration schemes you have your own personal fork which you commit to and an upstream fork:

```sh
git remote add personal git@github.com:personal/git-course.git
```

### Branching models

- GitFlow (`master`, `release/*`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`)
- CI (`master`, `feature/*`)

### Code review
